# DocsifyTest

This is a test markdown file for working with docsify-this.

It's got some inline equation stuff: $A=\frac{B}{j\pi}$ And it might soon have a mermaid chart.

## Oh, look!

It has got a mermaid chart...

```mermaid
gantt
    title A Gantt Diagram
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Section
    A task           :a1, 2014-01-01, 30d
    Another task     :after a1  , 20d
    section Another
    Task in sec      :2014-01-12  , 12d
    another task      : 24d
```

Wasn't that fun?
